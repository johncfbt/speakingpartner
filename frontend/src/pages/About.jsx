      <p className="text-left mb-1">As a person who talk stuttering for my past life, I know every moment that I struggle, and I always wanna find a way to feel better after the low times. I tried many ways, many tips, but I always think that if we can find someone for a chat, that will always make me feel better.</p>
      <p className="text-left mb-1">I build this website at my spare time, and hope can help you in some way.</p>
      <p className="text-left mb-1">More functions coming soon, feedback always welcome.</p>
      <p className="text-left mb-1">Thank you.</p>
